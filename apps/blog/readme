list: GET /api/blogposts/ List all blogposts.
create: POST /api/blogposts/ Create a new blogpost.
retrieve: GET /api/blogposts/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/ Show the details of a specific blogpost.
update: PUT /api/blogposts/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/ Update all fields of a specific blogpost.
partial update: PATCH /api/blogposts/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/ Update a field of a specific blogpost.
destroy: DELETE /api/blogposts/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/ Delete a specific blogpost.
